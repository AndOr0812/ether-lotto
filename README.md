# ether-lotto

This is an Ethereum based lottery written in Solidity.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. ~~See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.~~

### Prerequisites

You must have npm installed.

This project uses Consensys' [Truffle Framework](http://truffleframework.com) in order to test it. _If you don't have it installed already, it will be installed by npm._

### Installing

Clone this repository to your computer and go to its folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nGoline/ether-loto.git
cd ether-loto
```

Install project dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

### Running

We're using gulp to load and minify the needed files.

```bash
npm start
```

## Running the tests

No tests yet.

## Deployment

In this phase the project must not be deployed neither on the Mainnet nor on Testnets. It is intended to be tested until we have the main contract up and running.

To get a ready to deploy package just run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

And publish all the files on ```.\web\build\**\*```.
